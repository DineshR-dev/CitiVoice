<div class="container my-5">
    <h1 class="mb-4">How This Portal Works</h1>
    <p>
        This portal is built to give every citizen a voice.  
        People often face local problems such as poor infrastructure, safety issues, or community needs but they do not always reach the right authorities.  
        With this application, both <strong>complaints</strong> and <strong>new ideas</strong> are welcomed.  
        The purpose is to create a transparent system where everyone can highlight problems, share solutions, and make sure important issues are noticed by the people responsible for taking action.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Citizen Role</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Each citizen receives <strong>1 point per month</strong>.</li>
        <li>That point can be used to <strong>raise a complaint/idea</strong> or <strong>vote for an existing one</strong>.</li>
        <li>On the homepage, all current month’s complaints are listed, sorted by vote count (highest first).</li>
        <li>By voting, citizens help highlight the most urgent or useful complaints/ideas so admins can prioritize them.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Admin Role</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Admins also receive <strong>1 point per month</strong> to add a complaint/idea or vote for an existing one.</li>
        <li>In addition, each admin can <strong>take up to 2 complaints into action per month</strong>.</li>
        <li>Once a complaint is taken, the admin can update its status:
            <ul>
                <li><em>Not Taken</em> – default state</li>
                <li><em>Pending</em> – review in progress</li>
                <li><em>Active</em> – action is being taken</li>
                <li><em>Completed</em> – resolved successfully</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Admins can only take complaints assigned to their location (or general complaints).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Workflow</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>A citizen or admin creates a complaint/idea.</li>
        <li>Other users vote for the most relevant complaints.</li>
        <li>Complaints with the highest votes appear at the top of the homepage.</li>
        <li>Admins select complaints to take into action and update their statuses.</li>
        <li>Citizens can track progress through the complaint detail page.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Why This Matters</h2>
    <p>
        This platform ensures that <strong>everyone’s voice is heard</strong> and that issues with the greatest community support are addressed first.  
        It encourages participation, transparency, and accountability.  
        By working together citizens raising problems, admins taking responsibility, and votes highlighting priorities we create a better, more responsive community.
